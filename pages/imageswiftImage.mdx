# ImageSwiftImage Component

## Overview

The `ImageSwiftImage` component is an integral part of the **ImageSwift** library, designed to simplify the process of loading and displaying images in Unity UI elements in editor and runtime. This component extends the Unity UI `Image` component and seamlessly integrates with the `ImageSwift` library, providing enhanced functionality for image handling.

## Getting Started

### Adding ImageSwiftImage to your GameObject

* Drap and drop ImageSwiftImage script from the Projects
or
* In Inspector, click on `Add Component` - search for ImageSwiftImage.

### Basic Usage

The `ImageSwiftImage` component can be used directly within the Unity Editor. Simply attach it to a Unity UI `Image` GameObject, and you're ready to load and display images effortlessly.

### Loading Images

Load an image into the `ImageSwiftImage` component using the following steps:

1. Select the GameObject with the `ImageSwiftImage` component.

2. In the Inspector window, find the `ImageSwiftImage` component.

3. Input the image URL in the `Image URL` field.

4. Click on `Load Image` button.

## Features

## On Hover
The ImageSwiftImage component enhances Unity UI Images by providing a hover feature that includes scaling and filter change transitions. This allows developers to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces with ease.

#### Use Hover in ImageSwiftImage component
1. Attach the ImageSwiftImage script to a Unity UI Image component.
2. In the Unity Inspector, locate the "Allow hover" checkbox. Check this box to enable hover functionality.
3. From the dropdown menu next to "Hover type," select the desired hover effect. Currently, ImageSwiftImage supports scale transitions on hover.

#### Scale Hover
When "Scale" is chosen as the hover type, two additional properties become available:

**Hover Scale Factor:** Adjust the hoverScaleFactor to control the degree of scaling during the hover effect. A value of 1.0 represents no scaling, while values greater than 1.0 increase the size, and values less than 1.0 decrease the size.

**Hover Transition Duration:** Set the hoverTransitionDuration to determine the duration of the scaling animation during the hover effect. This value controls the speed of the scaling animation.


#### Filters (Coming Soon)
The "Filters" hover type is currently under development and will be available in future updates.

### Notes
<Alert>
Ensure that the Unity UI Image component has **Raycast Target** enabled to receive hover events.
