# ImageSwift Texture Manipulation

ImageSwift empowers developers with robust tools for manipulating textures, offering the flexibility to resize and crop images according to specific requirements. These features contribute to a dynamic and adaptive approach in handling textures within Unity projects.

## Resize

The resize function in ImageSwift enables developers to adjust the dimensions of a texture, providing flexibility in managing image sizes within the application. The resizing operation can be further refined using the following parameters:
* **Fit**: Resizes the texture to fit within the specified dimensions while maintaining its aspect ratio.
* **Cover**: Resizes the texture to cover the specified dimensions, potentially cropping parts of the image to maintain the aspect ratio.
* **Contain**: Resizes the texture to fit within the specified dimensions, adding padding if necessary to maintain the aspect ratio.

```csharp filename="C#"
ImageSwift.Load(url)
.Resize(900, 500, ResizeMode.Fit)
.Into(img_shadow_50).Start();
```

Parameters:  
`newWidth`: The target width of the resized texture.  
`newheight`: The target height of the resized texture.  
`resizeMode`: Enum specifying the resizing mode (Fit, Cover, or Contain).


## Crop
The `Crop` function in ImageSwift allows developers to precisely control the cropping of a texture, defining the starting coordinates and the new width and height of the cropped region.

```csharp filename="C#"
ImageSwift.Load(url)
.Crop(100, 500, 2048, 2048)
.Into(img_shadow_50).Start();
```

Parameters:  
`startX`: The starting X-coordinate of the cropped region.  
`startY`: The starting Y-coordinate of the cropped region.  
`newWidth`: The new width of the cropped region.  
`newHeight`: The new height of the cropped region.
