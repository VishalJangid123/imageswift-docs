# Image Loading in ImageSwift

## Overview

In **ImageSwift**, loading images into Unity GameObjects and sprites is a straightforward process. This section provides guidance on using the library to dynamically load and display images within your Unity project.

## Loading Images into GameObjects

### Loading into RawImage

To load an image into a Unity `RawImage` component, use the following code:

```csharp
ImageSwift.Load("https://example.com/image.jpg").Into(rawImageGameObject);
```

This loads the image from the specified URL and sets it as the texture for the RawImage component attached to the given GameObject.

Loading into SpriteRenderer
To load an image into a Unity SpriteRenderer component, you can use the following code:
```csharp
ImageSwift.Load("https://example.com/image.jpg").Into(spriteRendererGameObject);
```

This loads the image from the specified URL and sets it as the sprite for the SpriteRenderer component attached to the given GameObject.
